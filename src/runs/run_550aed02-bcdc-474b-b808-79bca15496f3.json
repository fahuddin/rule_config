The decision to approve, review, or deny the application is made by evaluating these factors.\n\n**Decision Logic**\n\n* If the applicant is at least 18 years old and their annual income is less than $40,000, then **APPROVE** the loan.\n* If the applicant has a cosigner, then **REVIEW** the loan to determine further action.\n* Otherwise, **DENY** the loan."
