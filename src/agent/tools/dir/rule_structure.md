# Rule Structure

A rule consists of:

- Branches: conditional paths (IF / ELSE IF / DEFAULT)
- Conditions: boolean expressions
- Actions: assignments or side effects
- Outputs: fields modified by the rule

A well-formed rule must:
- Contain at least one branch
- Contain at least one action
- Assign at least one output
